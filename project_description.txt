Description: An online search directory and listings website for finding driving instructors and driving schools around your location.

Built By: Riya Patel (200335493) & Pranav Kural (200333253)

Project criteria:

1. Build an application that references at least 2 data tables.

-> The project includes following primary tables: Instructors, DrivingSchools, DrivingSchool_Instructors

2. 1 One-To-Many relationship between tables and 1 One-To-One relationship

-> There is a One-To-Many relationship between the tables DrivingSchools and DrivingSchool_Instructors. Since one driving school can have many instructors, therefore there are several records of related instructors in DrivingSchool_Instructors table for each Driving School in the DrivingSchools table.

There is a One-To-One relationship between the tables Instructors and DrivingSchool_Instructors. One Instructor appears only once in the Instructor table, and only one in the DrivingSchool_Instructors table as well, because an instructor can be affiliated with only one driving school at a time.

3. Use jQuery to post client side requests and populate results on your page

-> We used the jQuery to post client side request to load the in-site secondary navigation for the Instructor views.

4. Enable/Disable areas of your application to logged in Users or Guests

-> We used a custom built AuthenticationAttribute, as an annotation, to authenticate and authorize users for different actions in different controllers.

5. Show use of integration with an external data source using Microsoft Azure
Must be SQL Server hosted on Azure
Enable Code-First Migrations to push your database updates to Azure

6. Host your Web Application on Azure

-> We are hosting are the application on Azure with a SQL database and SQL server, all in the same resource group. Code-First Migrations are enabled to push your database updates to Azure.
